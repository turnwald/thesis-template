\label{chap:discussion}

This chapter discusses the results presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:results} in relation to the objectives stated in the introduction.

\section{Interpretation of Results}

The results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of achieving the desired performance under the considered conditions. In particular, the reduction in error metrics suggests an improvement compared to baseline methods.

However, these improvements come at the cost of increased computational complexity, as indicated by the higher computation time reported in Table~\ref{tab:performance}.

\section{Limitations}

Several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the evaluation is restricted to a specific set of scenarios and assumptions. Second, parameter tuning plays a significant role in the observed performance and may limit generalization.

\section{Implications and Outlook}

Despite these limitations, the results provide valuable insights into the applicability of the proposed approach. Future work could address scalability, robustness under uncertainty, or validation on real-world systems.
